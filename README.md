This is an open-source application that uses Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and a deep neural network to detect neurological disorders.

# NeuralScan: A Detailed Guide for Usage and Contribution

## 1. Cloning the Repository

The first step to start contributing to the NeuroScan app is to clone the repository. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuroScan/NeuroScan.git
```

## 2. Setting up the Development Environment

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project's directory:

```bash
cd NeuroScan
```

The NeuroScan app is developed using Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.

We recommend using a virtual environment for development. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows, run:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Running Tests

To ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality, you should run tests before submitting a pull request. The NeuroScan app uses pytest for testing. You can run tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

## 4. Making Changes

Now you are ready to make changes. Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Make your changes and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## 5. Submitting a Pull Request

Once you have made your changes, you can push them to the repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, go to the NeuroScan GitHub page and click on "New pull request". Select your branch from the dropdown and click on "Create pull request".

## Conclusion

# NeuroScan Application Structure and Git Repository Design

## 1. Overview

NeuroScan is an open-source application that uses Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and deep neural networks to detect neurological disorders. This document outlines the architecture of the application, the flow of data, and the function of each module and component.

## 2. Application Architecture

The NeuroScan application is designed using a modular architecture, which is divided into three main parts:

1. **Data Acquisition Module**: This module is responsible for acquiring MEG signals from the hardware device.
2. **Data Preprocessing Module**: This module preprocesses the raw MEG signals to make them suitable for analysis.
3. **Neural Network Module**: This module uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the preprocessed MEG signals and detect neurological disorders.

```python
# Data Acquisition Module
class DataAcquisition:
    def acquire_data(self):
        pass

# Data Preprocessing Module
class DataPreprocessing:
    def preprocess_data(self):
        pass

# Neural Network Module
class NeuralNetwork:
    def train_model(self):
        pass

    def predict(self):
        pass
```

## 3. Data Flow

The data in the NeuroScan application flows sequentially through the modules:

1. The **Data Acquisition Module** collects raw MEG signals from the hardware device.
2. The raw MEG signals are then passed to the **Data Preprocessing Module**, where they are cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.
3. The preprocessed MEG signals are then fed into the **Neural Network Module**, which uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the signals and detect neurological disorders.

```python
# Data Flow
def main():
    # Instantiate the modules
    data_acquisition = DataAcquisition()
    data_preprocessing = DataPreprocessing()
    neural_network = NeuralNetwork()

    # Acquire raw MEG signals
    raw_data = data_acquisition.acquire_data()

    # Preprocess the raw MEG signals
    preprocessed_data = data_preprocessing.preprocess_data(raw_data)

    # Train the neural network model
    neural_network.train_model(preprocessed_data)

    # Predict neurological disorders
    predictions = neural_network.predict(preprocessed_data)

    return predictions
```

## 4. Function of Each Module and Component

- **Data Acquisition Module**: This module interfaces with the MEG hardware device to collect raw MEG signals. It ensures that the data is collected in a consistent and reliable manner.

- **Data Preprocessing Module**: This module cleans and transforms the raw MEG signals. It removes noise and other irrelevant information from the signals, normalizes the signals to a standard range, and structures the signals into a format suitable for analysis.

- **Neural Network Module**: This module uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the preprocessed MEG signals. It includes functions for training the neural network model and predicting neurological disorders based on the model.

## 5. Git Repository Structure

The Git repository for the NeuroScan application is structured as follows:

- **/data**: This directory contains the raw and preprocessed MEG signals.
- **/src**: This directory contains the source code for the application, divided into separate files for each module.
- **/models**: This directory contains the trained neural network models.
- **/docs**: This directory contains the documentation for the application.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the application and instructions for how to use it.
- **.gitignore**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

```bash
NeuroScan/
├── data/
├── src/
│   ├── data_acquisition.py
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py
│   └── neural_network.py
├── models/
├── docs/
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

This structure ensures that the code, data, models, and documentation are organized in a clear and logical manner, making the application easy to understand and maintain.
