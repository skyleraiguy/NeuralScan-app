# NeuroScanApp

## Overview

NeuroScanApp is an open-source application designed to detect neurological disorders using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and deep neural networks. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for both medical professionals and patients, enabling the easy input of MEG signals, processing of these signals, and interpretation of results.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of NeuroScanApp is to provide a reliable, efficient, and accessible tool for the early detection of neurological disorders. By leveraging the power of deep neural networks, the application can analyze MEG signals to detect patterns and anomalies that may indicate the presence of a neurological disorder.

## Technology

NeuroScanApp is built using a variety of technologies. The user interface is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The data processing module is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for efficient data manipulation. The deep neural network module is built using TensorFlow, a powerful library for machine learning and neural networks. The results interpretation module is also implemented in Python, using libraries such as Matplotlib for data visualization.

### Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Signals

MEG signals are the magnetic fields produced by electrical currents in the brain. These signals can be measured using a Magnetoencephalography machine. In NeuroScanApp, these MEG signals are used as input data for the deep neural network.

### Deep Neural Networks

Deep neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that can learn to recognize patterns in data. In NeuroScanApp, a deep neural network is trained on a large dataset of MEG signals from both healthy individuals and individuals with neurological disorders. The trained network can then analyze new MEG signals to detect patterns that may indicate a neurological disorder.

## Main Components

### User Interface

The user interface provides a simple and intuitive way for users to input MEG signals into the application. It is built using React and provides visual feedback to the user throughout the process.

### Data Processing Module

The data processing module is responsible for preparing the MEG signals for analysis by the deep neural network. This includes tasks such as filtering noise from the signals and normalizing the data.

### Neural Network Module

The neural network module is where the actual analysis of the MEG signals takes place. This module uses a deep neural network, implemented in TensorFlow, to detect patterns in the MEG signals that may indicate a neurological disorder.

### Results Interpretation Module

The results interpretation module takes the output of the neural network module and interprets it for the user. This includes visualizing the results and providing a clear and understandable explanation of the findings.
