# **NeuralScan App**

## 🧠 **Welcome to NeuralScan App Respository** 🧠

NeuralScan is an open-source application designed to detect neurological disorders using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and deep neural networks. This README provides an overview of the application's structure and usage guidelines.

## Usage Guide

### **Data Acquisition Module**

Click the "Start Acquisition" button in the application to initiate the data acquisition process.

### **Data Processing Module**

After data acquisition is complete, click the "Process Data" button to process the acquired MEG signals.

### **Neural Network Module**

Once data processing is complete, click the "Detect Disorders" button to use a deep neural network to detect neurological disorders from the processed MEG signals.

### **Results Module**

The results of the disorder detection will be displayed in the application after the process is complete.
