# NeuralScan Application

ðŸ§  **Welcome to NeuralScan** ðŸ§ 

NeuralScan is an open-source application designed to detect neurological disorders using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals and deep neural networks. This README provides an overview of the application's structure and usage guidelines.

## Usage Guide

### Data Acquisition Module

Click the "Start Acquisition" button in the application to initiate the data acquisition process.

### Data Processing Module

After data acquisition is complete, click the "Process Data" button to process the acquired MEG signals.

### Neural Network Module

Once data processing is complete, click the "Detect Disorders" button to use a deep neural network to detect neurological disorders from the processed MEG signals.

### Results Module

The results of the disorder detection will be displayed in the application after the process is complete.
